# Analysis-of-Simple-Pendulum-Characteristics-in-Varied-Environments-using-Arduino-and-Python
Pendulum Motion Data Collection and Plotting

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to collect data from a potentiometer using an Arduino and visualize the pendulum motion using Python. The potentiometer value is read by the Arduino, transmitted to Python via serial communication, and then plotted.

## Components Used
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Potentiometer (connected to analog pin A0)
Computer with Python installed
USB cable for Arduino-PC connection
